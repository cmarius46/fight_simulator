trying opencv library for hand detection on webcam

30fps seems a little low, it fails to detect fast hand movements as punches

current detection is made using cvzone -> looked around for documentation -> found source code at 
https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone/tree/master/cvzone
-> based on mediapipe module
